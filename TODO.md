- Replace "Update package info" task with a child process
- Support adding parent folders (i.e. `drivers/`) in task provider
- Combine autoproj-package and autoproj-workspace in a single task provider
- Refactor `extension.test.ts` and `commands.test.ts` to use a real workspace instead of mocks (see `cpptools.test.ts`)
- Add linter
- Install `ruby-lsp` automatically
  - Create a Gemfile in `.autoproj/vscode-autoproj` that does `eval_gemfile` on `install/gems/Gemfile` and adds `ruby-lsp` and `debug`
  - Do a `bundler install` after that
  - See `tasks.Handler` how to create a progress view
  - On startup:
    - If `.autoproj/vscode-autoproj/Gemfile.lock` does not exist
      - Does nothing
    - If `.autoproj/vscode-autoproj/Gemfile.lock` exists
      - If previous state is unknown, run `bundler install`
      - If current state != previous (saved as a json, file contents hash) state, run `bundler install`
      - If current state == previous state, does nothing
  - Monitor `install/gems/Gemfile.lock` for changes:
    - If `.autoproj/vscode-autoproj/Gemfile.lock` does not exist
      - Does nothing
    - If `.autoproj/vscode-autoproj/Gemfile.lock` exists
      - If previous state is unknown, run `bundler install`
      - If current state != previous (saved as a json) state, run `bundler install`
      - If current state == previous state, does nothing
  - Consider doing `eval_gemfile` on `.autoproj/Gemfile` as well (and monitoring the respective lock)
